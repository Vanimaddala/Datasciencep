        "1. Introduction\n",
        "1.1 Background\n",
        "The process of finding suitable housing involves numerous challenges, particularly in urban areas like São Paulo, where choices are abundant but varied in terms of quality, amenities, and neighborhood characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.2 Problem Statement\n",
        "When relocating for a new job, selecting an apartment becomes a critical decision. Specific requirements such as proximity to work, nearby amenities (like gyms and markets), and neighborhood economic and social attributes play a pivotal role in this decision-making process.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.3 Interest\n",
        "This project aims to assist individuals moving to São Paulo by providing data-driven insights into apartment rentals. It targets potential renters, newcomers to the city, and anyone interested in exploring rental trends and neighborhood characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data\n",
        "2.1 Data Sources\n",
        "Workplace Coordinates: Obtained using geocoding services to pinpoint the central location of interest.\n",
        "Rental Property Data: Scraped from a prominent online real estate portal, focusing on apartments within a 5km radius of the workplace.\n",
        "Venue Data: Leveraged the Foursquare API to gather information on nearby venues, including gyms and markets.\n",
        "2.2 Data Cleaning\n",
        "Address Standardization: Removed entries with incomplete addresses or missing location coordinates to ensure data integrity.\n",
        "Venue and Neighborhood Data: Cleaned and preprocessed to facilitate analysis, including grouping by neighborhood and venue category.\n",
        "3. Methodology\n",
        "3.1 Filtering by Distance\n",
        "Initial Filter: Narrowed down apartments to those within a 5km radius of the workplace, minimizing commute times and ensuring practicality.\n",
        "3.2 Extracting Specific Venues\n",
        "Venue Extraction: Utilized geocoding to determine the coordinates of each neighborhood and employed the Foursquare API to retrieve details of nearby venues.\n",
        "Visualization: Generated a heatmap to visualize the density and distribution of apartments and potential venues of interest like gyms and markets.\n",
        "3.3 Grouping Data\n",
        "Venue and Neighborhood Characteristics: Grouped neighborhoods based on the frequency of venue categories to identify the top 10 most common venues.\n",
        "Economic Attributes: Aggregated data on rental prices, property sizes, and bedroom counts to understand neighborhood economic profiles.\n",
        "3.4 Clustering\n",
        "K-Means Clustering: Employed clustering algorithms to categorize neighborhoods into clusters based on similarity in venue types and economic features.\n",
        "Cluster Analysis: Visualized clusters to identify predominant neighborhood profiles and potential patterns in rental property characteristics.\n",
        "3.5 Filtering for Potential Apartments\n",
        "Criteria Application: Applied filters for minimum bedroom requirements, maximum rent values, and proximity to essential venues like gyms and markets to identify viable apartment options.\n",
        "Map Visualization: Mapped potential apartments alongside nearest gyms and markets for each location to visualize accessibility and amenities.\n",
        "3.6 Final Dataset\n",
        "Integration: Integrated all relevant data (economic, social, and venue-related) to create a consolidated dataset of potential apartments, including neighborhood attributes and proximity to amenities.\n",
        "4. Results and Discussion\n",
        "Apartment Analysis: From an initial dataset of 3,000 apartments, filtered down to 17 viable options based on specified criteria.\n",
        "Cluster Insights: Identified high similarity among neighborhoods, with one cluster encompassing approximately 64% of the sampled areas.\n",
        "Final Dataset Overview: Provided a comprehensive overview of potential apartments, highlighting economic, social, and amenity-related attributes for informed decision-making.\n",
        "5. Conclusion\n",
        "Achievements: Successfully applied data science techniques to streamline the apartment selection process in São Paulo, focusing on key factors such as proximity to work, amenities, and neighborhood characteristics.\n",
        "Recommendations: Suggested future improvements, such as incorporating additional quality-of-life indicators and expanding the geographic scope of data collection for broader insights.\n",
        "Appendix\n",
        "Methodology Diagrams: Detailed flowcharts illustrating the step-by-step data processing and analysis procedures.\n",
        "Code Snippets: Sample excerpts showcasing data cleaning, visualization techniques, and clustering algorithms used in the project.\n",
